read.C takes the numi spill info generated by robert hatcher "all_data_numi_runs_4_7.dat" and makes a TGraph with time stamp vs n_batches vs nsec, though nsec doesn't seem to be necessary

outputTree.C takes that TGraph, loops through the numi data and for each event loops through the TGraph looking for an exact (to the second) match between the acc timestamp and the detector timestamp while taking into account the leap second offset (acc uses "clinks" while detector is usual unix time).  then a new tree is created with only 5-batch spills to be used for timing analyses, in particular the early bkg-enhanced stuff.  This code apparently doesn't produce useful root file on joe's laptop so it was ran on fmb05 at /scratch/condor-tmp/grange/batches/ and then copied to his laptop.
